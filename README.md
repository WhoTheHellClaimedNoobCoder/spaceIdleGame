# spaceIdleGame
So its basically an idle game about space exploration, you have to manage electricity for your fuel machines, launch rockets etc.
I made it open source so if people want they can make community editions and i can even put some i like here
Im doing this as practice so i can gain more knowledge, maybe ill keep updating it but maybe ill add an ending and make another game or even a sequel.
